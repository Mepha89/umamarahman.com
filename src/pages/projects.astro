            Taking inspriation (and frustration) from the Government of NL's
            ferry services, our group has decided to create a ferry reservation
            web application. It allows users to view the ferry schedule much
            easier and enables the additional reservation functionality.

            The app allows users to search for their desired crossing, make a
            booking, check the status of their booking, cancel their booking.
            The app will also send email confirmation when the user makes a
            booking.

            The game includes an AI opponent with varying levels of difficulty

          <p>
            The game's design follows SOLID principles, ensuring a clean and
            modular codebase that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
            Each class has a single responsibility and is highly cohesive,
            leading to a more robust architecture.

            This is the first course in University of Helsinki computer science
            learning track, and we use industry-grade tooling from day one. As
            such, the course is about programming in a real integrated
            development environment (IDE) instead of a browser or an educational
            IDE.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course is split up into two individual courses: Java Programming
            I and Java Programming II. Each course consists of seven parts, each
            with its own exercise set. Completing a single part takes
            approximately 5-20 hours.
